# SignupForm
An ASP.NET MVC Web App allowing users to signup, and view all members.

## What I learned
I am beginning to get into Full-Stack Web Developement to broaden my skills, so that I will be able to create any type of application I or a client might need.
I also learned how to use two seperate Models, for front-end and back-end respectively. Using one model to scaffold a view, and add front-end validation, and the other
to create the actual record in the database

## Features
- Allows the user to signup with a username, email and password
- Allows the user to view all current members/users
- Stores accounts into a database (passwords not included)
- Front-end validation using Data Annotations
